Description

In this homework, you will again draw the same shape as in the homework 2. But this time, using loops are prohibited. You will implement it with recursions. Please make sure you follow these rules in your implementation: 
You will use recursions to draw the shapes.
You are not allowed to use any kind of loops.
You are not allowed to use lists or string variables.
You are not allowed to use multiplication in print statements.
You can only print one of the followings in your print statements: ' ', '*', 'o', '\\', '/', '||', '--'.
We provided two lines of code to take input from the user: first glass_size and then straw_pos. Don't change it and also you shouldn't write any extra input taking part in your code.
Assume that straw_pos will not be greater than glass_size*2 (straw_pos <= glass_size*2).
straw_pos and glass_size will be strictly greater than zero (straw_pos > 0 and glass_size > 0).
Here is the description of the homework: You will write a Python program to implement the ASCII cocktail glasses below using two parameters glass_size as the size of the cocktail glass and straw_pos as the position of the straw. Your code will draw a cocktail that decreases as you drink it through a straw. One example run is given at the bottom of this page. You can find other example runs in the example_runs.txt file. 
Warning: You are not allowed to use imports and topics that haven't been covered yet. 
Warning: Do not print any additional/unnecessary things as output. Your outputs should exactly match with the test case outputs.
